# üéâ Webhook with PHP 

This project is a basic implementation of a **Webhook** in PHP. In this case, we have a server that listens for **POST** requests containing JSON data, processes the data, and returns a JSON response. Additionally, a PHP client sends a request to the Webhook to trigger the process.
